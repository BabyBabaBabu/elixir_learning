# Elixir Learning

A code repo for my sample codes while learnin Elixir

## Requirements
You'll need the following installed on your machine.

```Erlang Version 26```

```Elixir version 1.15```

These were the current versions at the start of my learning.

To check if successfully installed, run

```elixir --version```
